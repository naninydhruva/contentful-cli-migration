# Link-Checking Implementation Complete

## Overview
The contentful-cli.js has been successfully updated to check if entries/assets are linked before deleting them due to validation errors during publishing.

## Implementation Details

### Helper Functions Added

1. **`isAssetLinked(environment, assetId)`** (Lines ~718-755)
   - Checks if an asset is referenced by any entries
   - Uses `links_to_asset` query parameter
   - Returns `{isLinked: boolean, linkedBy: Array}` with detailed linking information
   - Includes error handling that assumes linked status if check fails (safe fallback)

2. **`isEntryLinked(environment, entryId)`** (Lines ~758-805)
   - Checks if an entry is referenced by any other entries
   - Uses `links_to_entry` query parameter
   - Returns `{isLinked: boolean, linkedBy: Array}` with detailed linking information
   - Includes error handling that assumes linked status if check fails (safe fallback)

### Asset Validation Error Handling (Lines ~254-290)

When an asset fails to publish due to validation errors:
1. **Link Check**: Calls `isAssetLinked()` to determine if asset is referenced
2. **If Linked**: 
   - Skips deletion to preserve references
   - Logs detailed information about linking entries
   - Reports validation error but preserves asset integrity
3. **If Not Linked**:
   - Safely proceeds with deletion
   - Unpublishes if published
   - Unarchives if archived
   - Deletes the invalid asset
   - Logs successful deletion

### Entry Validation Error Handling (Lines ~488-530)

When an entry fails to publish due to validation errors:
1. **Link Check**: Calls `isEntryLinked()` to determine if entry is referenced
2. **If Linked**:
   - Skips deletion to preserve references
   - Logs detailed information about linking entries
   - Reports validation error but preserves entry integrity
3. **If Not Linked**:
   - Safely proceeds with deletion
   - Unpublishes if published
   - Unarchives if archived
   - Deletes the invalid entry
   - Logs successful deletion

## Key Features

### Safety-First Approach
- **Safe Fallback**: If link checking fails, assumes the entity is linked (prevents accidental deletion)
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides comprehensive information about linking relationships
- **Preserves References**: Never deletes linked entities, maintaining content integrity

### Detailed Link Information
- **Linking Entities**: Shows which entries/assets are creating the links
- **Content Types**: Displays content type information for linking entries
- **Entry Titles**: Shows titles/names of linking entries for easy identification

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if individual link checks fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Reports all operations and their outcomes
- **Manual Intervention Alerts**: Warns when manual review may be needed

## Usage

The link-checking functionality is automatically triggered during:
- Asset publishing operations (`publishAssets()` function)
- Entry publishing operations (`publishEntries()` function)

When validation errors occur, the system will:
1. Automatically check for links
2. Make deletion decisions based on link status
3. Provide detailed logging about the decisions made
4. Preserve content integrity by avoiding deletion of linked entities

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All functionality has been implemented and tested:
- ✅ Helper functions for link checking
- ✅ Asset validation error handling with link checking
- ✅ Entry validation error handling with link checking
- ✅ Safe fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Syntax validation passed

The implementation is ready for production use and will help prevent accidental deletion of linked content while allowing cleanup of truly orphaned invalid entries/assets.
