  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

## üß™ Testing Results

### Core Functionality Tests ‚úÖ
```
=== Testing hasNoData Method ===
‚úÖ Completely empty entry: hasNoData = true
‚úÖ Entry with empty fields: hasNoData = true  
‚ùå Entry with meaningful data: hasNoData = false
‚ùå Entry with link reference: hasNoData = false
‚úÖ Entry with empty link array: hasNoData = true

=== Configuration Test ===
‚úÖ Loaded rules: 3
‚úÖ Enabled rules: 3
‚úÖ Found "remove-completely-empty-entries" rule
‚úÖ Has hasNoData operator integration
```

## üöÄ Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Entry Analysis
- **Detailed field analysis**: Examines every field across all locales
- **Data type detection**: Handles arrays, objects, links, and primitives
- **Comprehensive validation**: Robust error handling for malformed data
- **Performance metrics**: Calculates data completeness percentages

### Safe Deletion Process
- **Pre-deletion analysis**: Confirms entry has no meaningful data
- **Reference detection**: Finds all entries linking to target entry
- **Automatic unlinking**: Removes references before deletion
- **Verification**: Confirms successful unlinking before proceeding
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed tracking of all operations

### Flexible Rule System
- **Universal content type support**: `*` wildcard for all types
- **Multiple condition types**: `isEmpty`, `hasNoData`, `equals`, etc.
- **Logical operators**: Complex AND/OR rule combinations
- **Environment specificity**: Different rules per environment
- **Safety configurations**: Unlinking requirements and confirmation

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Data Integrity Protection
- **Link verification**: Confirms entries are unlinked before deletion
- **Reference validation**: Checks for remaining links after unlinking
- **Error recovery**: Handles partial failures gracefully
- **Rollback capability**: Stops deletion if unlinking fails

### Environment Protection
- **Deletion limits**: Configurable maximum deletions per run
- **Confirmation requirements**: Optional user confirmation for sensitive operations
