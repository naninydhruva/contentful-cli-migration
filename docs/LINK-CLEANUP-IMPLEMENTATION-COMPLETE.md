## ⚡ Key Features Implemented

### **1. Smart Link Detection & Validation**
```javascript
// Validates each link by attempting to fetch the resource
const validLink = await validateLink(environment, link);
```
- Detects broken entry and asset links
- Distinguishes between temporary errors and permanent failures
- Handles malformed link structures gracefully

### **2. Comprehensive Link Cleaning**
```javascript
// Removes only confirmed broken links
const result = await cleanEntryLinks(entry, environment);
// Returns detailed statistics about what was cleaned
```
- Preserves valid links and non-link content
- Handles both single links and arrays of links
- Maintains data integrity throughout the process

### **3. Batch Processing with Rate Limiting**
```javascript
// Process entries in configurable batches
await processEntriesForLinkCleaning(environment, {
  batchSize: 10,
  maxEntries: 1000,
  shouldPublish: true
});
```
- Intelligent batch processing to prevent memory issues
- Built-in rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Real-time progress reporting

### **4. Enterprise-Grade Error Handling**
- Comprehensive validation of entry structures
- Safe handling of corrupted or malformed data
- Graceful degradation with detailed error reporting
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures

## 🎯 Available Commands

### **Core Commands**
```bash
# Scan for broken links (safe, no changes)
node cf-link-cleanup.js scan

# Clean broken links and update entries
node cf-link-cleanup.js clean

# Clean broken links and publish entries
node cf-link-cleanup.js clean-and-publish
```

### **Advanced Options**
```bash
# Filter by content type
node cf-link-cleanup.js scan --content-type articleListGeneral

# Process specific space/environment
node cf-link-cleanup.js clean --space-id your-space --env-id master

# Dry run before making changes
node cf-link-cleanup.js clean --dry-run --max-entries 10

# Control batch processing
node cf-link-cleanup.js clean --batch-size 5 --max-entries 100
```

## 📊 Comprehensive Reporting

### **Verified Functionality**
- ✅ Detects and removes non-existent entry links
- ✅ Detects and removes non-existent asset links
- ✅ Handles arrays and single links correctly
- ✅ Preserves valid links and content
- ✅ Implements proper rate limiting
- ✅ Provides detailed statistics

## 🚀 Production Usage

### **Recommended Workflow**
1. **Scan first** - Always understand the scope
2. **Dry run** - Preview changes before applying
3. **Small batch** - Test with limited entries
4. **Verify** - Check results with another scan
5. **Full run** - Process larger datasets
6. **Monitor** - Watch logs for any issues

### **Command Examples**
```bash
# Step 1: Understand the scope
node cf-link-cleanup.js scan --max-entries 50

# Step 2: Test cleaning
node cf-link-cleanup.js clean --dry-run --max-entries 10

# Step 3: Actual cleaning
node cf-link-cleanup.js clean --max-entries 100

# Step 4: Full production run
node cf-link-cleanup.js clean-and-publish
```

## 💡 Integration Options

### **CLI Usage**
Direct command-line usage for manual operations and scripts.

### **Programmatic Usage**
```javascript
const { runLinkCleanup } = require('./cf-link-cleanup');

await runLinkCleanup('scan', {
  spaceId: 'your-space-id',
  envId: 'master',
  maxEntries: 100
});
```
